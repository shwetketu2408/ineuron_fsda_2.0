Once the unemployment ran out we started having serious trouble making XXXX the XXXX and XXXX mortgage payments and fell behind. ,,,,,,,,,,,,

We turned to the North Carolina Foreclosure Prevention Fund and were approved for their program. The NCFPF then made good our back payments for both mortgages and continued to make payments for a little over a year until our maximum had been reached. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By the time the NCFPF ran out my wife got XXXX or and while they are a true blessing it did n't help improve our continuing financial issues. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We again got behind on both the XXXX and XXXX mortgages. By this time wife has found gainful employment full time ( 30 hours a week ) with a local bookkeeper. However it took all of our income just to keep the lights on or heat or groceries or car insurance and all the other necessities of daily life and left little to no extra money for the mortgages. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We then turned to our local HUD approved agency for assistance with a HAMP modification. The HUD agency is the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. We also sought the assistance of another legal agency or the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX that provides us with a free attorney. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The attorney proved to be very helpful since the XXXX mortgage company has been trying to foreclose on our home for almost a year and we have been to court more than XXXX times or each time resulting in a postponement while we were working through the HAMP process with XXXX. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"We were told throughout this entire process by our XXXX mortgage company and our HUD rep that once we were approved for the HAMP with our XXXX mortgage company we would automatically be approved for a 2MP with our XXXX mortgage company.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
After calling my HUD rep at XXXX she was able to find out that because our HAMP mod with the XXXX was an FHA HAMP we did n't qualify for an automatic XXXX approval. This is something that my HUD rep was also not aware of for this entire process. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"So now I am filing this complaint on the advice of my HUD rep hoping that I can get some kind of positive resolution to this XXXX mortgage modification issue.

They are either purposely trying to take our home away or have a very dysfunctional process.

This is what caused for us to fall behind the loss of income or and the recovery time of my surgery. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The good news is we are all back on our feet.. Our financial problems were due to inconsistent income and some unfortunate events as described above. We were forced to temporary discontinue making our mortgage payments. Without our income we fell into a financial chasm or but we tried to keep up with the mortgage payments for as long as we could. Ultimately we fell behind on our payments or what we want is to resume making our mortgage payments. Every other creditor that we contacted was very understanding and worked with me through our temporary financial and health crises or but BB & T Mortgage is refusing to come to the table with any tangible solution for assistance. During all of this we have tried and complied with BB & T Mortgage to get some help with our mortgage or buy agreeing with the forbearance plan but they wo n't listen and have denied me access to government homeowner assistance programs. No matter how many times we have contacted them or it has been a futile effort. We have not had a single point of contact nor have they offered any sort of assistance or repayment plan to get our payments on track. They insist that we pay our entire past due amount or but this is impossible and we are left with no options because they will not work with me. We have been given the runaround by them and just feel they are acting as judge or jury and executioner regarding our options without fairly reviewing our financial circumstances. If we truly can not afford our home or then we will move or but we believe that our loan fits squarely within government guidelines. We are hoping you could reach out to them on our behalf so we can save our home from an impending foreclosure sale. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What we want : We simply want a review of our mortgage for all available retention options so that we can keep our home. We do not need a handout or be given something we do n't deserve or but we want the opportunity to be treated fairly. Our financial future looks bright and we will not have any financial issues moving forward if we can get this resolved reasonably. Thank you in advance for any help you could provide. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2015-03-31,Credit card,,Privacy,,"On Monday XXXX XXXX between XXXX & XXXX PST or I contacted my Sears credit card to inquire about a charge and a renewed credit card. I spoke to a representative who could do nothing but apologize about not being able to help me. That CSR could not access my account for some unexplainable reason. Suddenly or I was transferred to another CSR in XXXX. That representative immediately asked for my """""""" personal password. '' I was confused by this because they are not allowed to ask for my personal password. They 're supposed to identify me by asking for the answer to certain secret questions or which I previously set up. When I inquired about why they were asking for my """""""" personal password '' I was told that was the way it is. I was feeling suspicious of who I was speaking with after the transfer and believed it to not be Sears Credit Card services at all. Too many hackers and identity thief 's are out there today and after this experience I decided something was wrong. I then ask to speak to a manager or more precisely or someone higher up. The manager whose name was XXXX ( or XXXX ) got on the phone and was immediately defensive & borderline rude. She kept interrupting me & would not allow me to clarify the situation & basically was unhelpful. I never raised my voice or said anything inappropriate. I even asked about the language to be certain I understood what they were trying to ask of me. I thought maybe it was a matter of semantics & language. This manager would not acknowledge that to be the case or which made me feel hesitant to release any information to these """""""" representatives. '' In any case or XXXX refused to neither help me & clarify my concerns nor solve any issues. She was quick to let me know that everyone followed a script and they have to ask the question as it is written. I understand this to an extent or because I worked in XXXX. We had scripts or but were also taught to listen to the customers. After all or they may a reason for their questions. Not everyone calling in is out to scream or yell & lodge complaints. That was not the purpose of my call. All I wanted was clarification about the personal password request & conduct my business accordingly. I did not get to conduct my business. I did not get answers to the questions I had. All I was told by this manager was that that 's the way it was ; reading the script verbatim and asking for customer 's personal passwords. In my opinion or this was utterly ludicrous. This is exactly how identity theft begins. I realized XXXX was not going to assist in any formidable way or which is a shame. I simply said thank you and have a nice day before hanging up. I was not about to get involved in a hacking situation or breach of security issue or especially not knowing for certain who I was actually speaking with. I wanted to report this because I do not believe I was represented well by Sears 's Credit Cards services. And I do not want to see other people have their personal account information compromised toward the possibility of identity theft. These representatives forgot that they are a consumer as well & they did n't provide good customer service. They did not care and put my personal account in jeopardy. In the end or I did not believe I was talking to the credit card company and if I was talking to the credit card company then they should probably go back and review that call center location in XXXX and the practices they have written into their script or which promotes jeopardizing customer accounts. What concerns me is that Sears did not protect me or was concerned with my personal security at all & it brings to question things such as a lack of professionalism or identity theft & good customer service. I also seriously question their business ethics & will consider changing my services. ",,,,,,,,,,,,

2015-03-31,Debt collection,I do not know,False statements or representation,Attempted to collect wrong amount,In XX/XX/XXXX I started services with XXXX and within 3 weeks of having the service I started experiencing issues with the way they dispatch and the product they supplied. XX/XX/XXXX I took a trip to the XXXX XXXX when a burglary alarm was set off in the house and they contacted me. I mentioned to them that I was out of the country and right away they should have said we will send the appropriate authorities or instead I got off the phone with them and ended up calling them back to have them send a police officer over to the house. Products they gave to me started faulting within 3 months of me purchasing. I was not satisfied with the way my system was handled when installation occurred. I 've contacted XXXX about why the cameras were not recording and I was then told that I had to set them up the way I wanted them to. The brand new sensor on the front door faulted within 3 months of me having the system and had to have them come out to replace it or at the same time the brand new key fob that was given with the system faulted and needed to be replaced. The gentleman who came out to fix the door sensor attempted to replace the battery in the fob and that did not work. He said that he would order a new one and when it arrived I would need to contact XXXX to set up another time for him to come out and program the new fob to the system. I or to this day or still have not received said key fob. With all these problems associated with XXXX or I remained level headed and figured that maybe I misunderstood my responsibilities as account holder. The situation that put me over the edge happened on XX/XX/XXXX or where my alarm system was activated. XXXX consistently called me with no answer and none of the individuals on my emergency call list or along with none of the appropriate authorities. I then contact them on XX/XX/XXXX due to my schedule and availability at that time to discuss termination of services because I was not satisfied. I am told that there is an early termination fee associated and I mention that I am not going to pay it because they breached their contract. After going back and forth and being transferred multiple times or I was then notified that I can send in a dispute letter stating why I do not want or feel that I should have to pay this fee. I send in the letter and today or XX/XX/XXXX or I find out that this account is going into collections. Once I got off the phone with the XXXX or XXXX representative on XXXX XXXX or I have not heard anything from them in regards to the status of my dispute. Why am I receiving notification that this is going into collection? Once I contacted them today XX/XX/XXXX or I am notified after speaking to XXXX different people that they decided that the charges were valid or I explain to the last representative in detail how the charges should not be valid and she then goes to say that I am lieing.

Over the past 5 years I have requested a modification to reduce the interest and payments. I have completed forms and submitted at least XXXX packages. Over and over it goes. A former consultant at NY XXXX XXXX woman XXXX XXXX who was helping people like me submitted a document informing Bank America that during this process I will be submitting the escrow payment monthly.

2015-04-30,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,Loan servicing or payments or escrow account,,There are a couple of issues. When my mortgage ( by XXXX XXXX ) was sold a past due balance was transferred to the new mortgage company ( Nationstar Mortgage ). I spoke to Nationstar and was told repeatedly that this balance was part of a forbearance that the XXXX issued but all of the information had not been sent over yet. When it continued to appear on my statement I called and called or waited long periods of time to reach a person or having that person ask if they could place me on hold while they reviewed the account and made notations at which time the phone would begin to ring again and another person would answer and ask if they could have my loan number. This happens or at least or 4 times during each call until I am forced to hang up. In addition or they have tacked on a large amount for insurance they claim to have not been able to verify. This is incorrect. XXXX advised they sent over the insurance information and my insurance carrier said Nationstar could see if there was coverage on the home. Nationstar charges {$9.00} to make an online payment if the payment is made after the last day of the month regardless if the payment is past due or not. Past due payments are charged this fee plus a late fee. If the payment is made via phone the fee is {$19.00}. I have paid additional monies on several of my payments trying to put the mortgage a month ahead in order to avoid the online payment fees. Each month the overage is applied to the principal. When I have spoken with Nationstar they say that 's just the way it is and ca n't be undone.

2015-04-30,Mortgage,Other mortgage,Loan modification orcollection orforeclosure,,I have been trying to obtain a modification of my current mortgage for 4 years. Please see # XXXX. Bank of America recently responded with letter that has inaccurate information. This has been their pattern for 4 years. I am under the impression the Making Home Affordable program can help me reduce my payment to 31 % ( or less ) of my gross income. My payment ( principal + interest + tax + insurance ) is currently {$2000.00}. I have asked many times for a MODIFICATION to a fixed rate loan. I am currently on an adjustable rate loan. In Bank of America 's recent communication copied to CFPB or the letter states I requesed a REFINANCE. That is not true. Had Bank of America modified my loan 4 years ago or my payment would have been reduced approximately {$400.00} per month or but they have drug this out as my income has slowly increased and reducing my payment now would only result in a reduction of a few dollars - my ask is that this be done and that I be on a fixed rate loan or not an adjustable rate loan that can increase beyond my ability to pay. I have not asked for my principal to be reduced or only that my loan be modified to a fixed rate with a payment less than 31 % of my income. Delays in inaccurate calculations over the last 4 years do not seem reasonable or legal to me. I am current on my payments but fear the next increase will push the payment beyond my means.,Company chooses not to provide a public response,Bank of America,WA,981XX,,Consent provided,Web,30-04-2015,Closed,Yes,No,1355544

I was called regarding this or and the gentleman I spoke with said I could get either XXXX points ( ~ {$32.00} ) or or cancel the account and get a refund of the annual fee. However or even refunding the annual fee does not account for the loss I have taken to my credit score in applying for this card or which includes both a hard credit pull and a lowering of my average account age or both of which can affect the interest rates I receive in the long-term. I was aware of this when I applied for the card or but at the time or it was worth it for the benefit of the XXXX night free.

2015-04-30,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,Application or originator or mortgage broker,,XXXX major issues that have been poorly handled by this institution. ,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rate lock - From what I understand or they set the expectation with you that they had secured your rate when they had not and it was actually floating. If I am correct or this costed you some money when it was finally locked. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Zoning Issue - I know very well about this as I helped you resolve it. If I recall or the unit is in a building which was categorized non-conforming due to the possibility of not being able to rebuild in case on catastrophic damage. This lender was unable to solve this and only when I worked through a colleague in Florida was it determined that a waiver letter was acceptable. Based on our discussion or you shared this solution with them and they sorted it out or but they should have been able to resolve without delay and inconvenience to you. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DTI - In our last discussion or you are now telling me that they are scrambling to resolve a DTI issue resulting from confusion on which debt is personal and which is associated with your business. This should in no way be a last minute issue and should have been resolved at application or after approval or at the very latest. I have not yet reviewed your commitment letter or but I would request it from them as it would have to address this or they are altering a committed deal which is not allowable. In short or if they approved you and told you what they need to close or they can not add items unless your financial situation has changed. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Blown Dates - Throughout the process or they seem to be stringing you along with consistent unmet promises for dates of approval or issue resolution. This has eliminated your ability to find alternate financing further jeopardizing your transaction and money. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
